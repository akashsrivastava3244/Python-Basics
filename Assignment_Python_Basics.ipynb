        "Ans - Conditional statements in Python allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. They're used to execute specific blocks of code when a condition is true and can include alternative actions if the condition is false. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif (else if), and else.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of how they work with examples:\n",
        "1. **if Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to True.\n",

        "        In this case, since age is less than 18, it will print \"You are a minor.\"\n",
        "3. **if-elif-else Statement**\n",
